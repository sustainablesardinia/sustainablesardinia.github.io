**AVOID MESSING WITH THIS FOLDER.**

It contains SASS files that define default styles for things like buttons, dropdown
menus, forms...

You can easily choose to not load specific styles by overriding the `$partials`
variable in your `_variables.scss`. Default variables are defined in `utils/_variables.scss`:

    $partials: (
      base,
      button,
      dropdown,
      form,
      layout,
      loading,
      modal,
      notification,
      switch,
      tooltip
    ) !default;

This means you can decide to only load the base styles (`partials/_base.scss`) and
buttons (`partials/_button.scss`) by adding the following declaration to your
`_variables.scss` file at the root of your egg folder:

    $partials: (
      base,
      button
    );
