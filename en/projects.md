[**Air quality**](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/air-quality). The
quantities of particulate in the air in the metropolitan city of Cagliari are
much higher than the thresholds given by the WHO. Where are they higher? And
why? What can we do to improve this?

[**Technical-scientific
dictionary**](https://github.com/{{site.github}}/lemariu-tennicu-scientificu).
In most dictionaries of Sardinian there are few technical terms, and very often
they're italian words that are "sard-ised" directly, without analysis, or
nonetheless terms that aren't translated in the same way a technical person
would translate them. Let's try to collect all the used technical terms! 

[**Educational poverty**](https://github.com/{{site.github}}/educational-poverty).
Educational poverty is the effect of the socio-economic condition of families over the
learning of students. In Sardinia, the data is very worrying, but some is missing or
spread across multiple reports. We aim to put this data together in a report that those
who work in this sector can use.
