Here we go! The first post in this website, that I managed to finally put
together. 

If you've just come here, please take some time to go read more about what
Sardinia Sustainability is, its manifesto, and how to contribute by clicking on
the links in the navigation bar.

Also, please do follow Sardinia Sustainability on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}),
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/{{ site.facebook }}), and
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}). On these social
media, I've been posting some interesting articles and websites that touch some
of the topics within the interests of this initiative, so following can be a
good way to learn more.

At the moment of writing, Sardinia Sustainability has only two projects, of
which I'm project coordinator, and I'm in the process of defining their details.
This shouldn't stop you from [sending an
email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) to propose a project or ask for
more info.

*Andrea Picciau, the coordinator*
